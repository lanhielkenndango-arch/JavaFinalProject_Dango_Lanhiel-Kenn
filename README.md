Project Title

Basic Series Circuit Calculator

Problem Statement

- This program aims to solve a basic series circuit such as voltage, current, and resistance. Beginners may often struggle when multiple resistance are involved and also applying the Kirchhoff’s Voltage Law (KVL). This project aims to solve problem by providing an automated calculator that allows users to calculate voltage, current, and resistance in a basic series circuit depending on what they choose, if it is a console based solving or by using Graphical User Interface (GUI). 

Program Features

- The program has dual interface mode that lets user to solve either in console based or by using the GUI. It is capable on solving the voltage, current, and resistance. It also handles multiple resistance and automatically total it all. Lastly, the GUI has calculate button to get the result, a reset button so that they won’t need to run the program over again, and a main menu button that brings back to the main jframe.

How to Run the Program

Option 1: Console Version
- Open the project in NetBeans or any Java IDE.
- Make sure to create to create a file name “JavaFinalProject” and a java class name “SeriesOfResistance” inside the javafinalproject file.
- Press F6 to run the file or right click then find run file.

Option 2: Using GUI  
- Create a two jframe file namely “Physics” and “Series”, make sure the file is inside the javafinalproject.
- Run the same file in option 1.
- Choose “4” the GUI version.
